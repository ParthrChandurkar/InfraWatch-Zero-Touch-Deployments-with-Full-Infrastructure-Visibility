# InfraWatch Architecture

InfraWatch has two explicit modes.

## Demo Mode

```text
Vercel React frontend
  -> Vercel /api rewrite
  -> FastAPI
  -> manifest simulation
  -> mock metrics/logs
```

Demo Mode is safe for public portfolio review. It does not run Kubernetes workloads.

## Real Local Kubernetes Mode

```text
Minikube
  -> frontend Deployment
  -> Nginx /api proxy
  -> backend Service
  -> FastAPI
  -> kubectl
  -> user workload Deployment + Service
  -> Prometheus/Loki/Grafana/Alertmanager
```

Real mode is enabled by Kubernetes config:

- `INFRAWATCH_EXECUTE_KUBECTL=true`
- `INFRAWATCH_ALLOW_MOCK_OBSERVABILITY=false`
- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...`

## Deployment flow

```text
GitHub
  -> GitHub Actions validate job
  -> Docker build
  -> DockerHub image tagged with GITHUB_SHA
  -> Kubernetes apply
  -> kubectl set image
  -> kubectl rollout status
```

The workflow uses immutable SHA tags for the rollout. The `latest` tag is also pushed for convenience, but Kubernetes deployment uses `${GITHUB_SHA}`.

## Application flow

```text
Browser
  -> React dashboard
  -> Nginx /api proxy
  -> infrawatch-backend Service
  -> FastAPI
  -> kubectl
  -> Kubernetes Deployment/Service
```

The frontend container uses Nginx to serve static assets and proxy `/api/*` to `http://infrawatch-backend:8000/`. This avoids adding Ingress just to connect the dashboard to the API in Minikube.

## Deployment request internals

1. React sends service name, image, replicas, and port.
2. FastAPI validates with Pydantic.
3. FastAPI generates a Kubernetes `List` containing:
   - Deployment
   - Service
4. In Demo Mode, the manifest is returned and state is recorded without kubectl.
5. In real mode:
   - `kubectl apply -f -`
   - `kubectl rollout status deployment/<name>`
   - `kubectl get deployment/<name> -o json`
   - Ready and available replicas are verified.
6. The deployment is marked `Running` only after rollout verification.
7. Rollout failures are stored as `Failed` with failure details.

## Rollback flow

```text
React rollback action
  -> POST /deployment/{name}/rollback
  -> kubectl rollout undo deployment/{name}
  -> kubectl rollout status
  -> ready/available replica verification
  -> audit event
```

Rollback is intentionally simple. It uses standard Kubernetes Deployment revision history instead of a custom release database.

## Metrics flow

```text
Application/Kubernetes
  -> Prometheus scrape
  -> FastAPI /metrics/{service}
  -> React charts
```

Prometheus sources:

- kubelet/cAdvisor metrics for CPU and memory.
- kube-state-metrics for pod/deployment/HPA state.
- FastAPI `/metrics` or `/internal/metrics` for app request metrics.
- annotated managed pods with `prometheus.io/scrape=true`.

Backend queries:

- CPU: `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total`
- Memory: `container_memory_working_set_bytes`
- Request rate: `http_requests_total`
- Error rate: `http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}`

In real mode, mock fallback is disabled. If Prometheus is unavailable, the API returns an error instead of fake data.

## Logs flow

```text
Application stdout/stderr
  -> Kubernetes container logs
  -> Promtail
  -> Loki
  -> FastAPI /logs/{service}
  -> React near-real-time log polling
```

The dashboard polls every 5 seconds. This is near-real-time log streaming via polling, not WebSockets.

Promtail labels pods with:

- `namespace`
- `pod`
- `app`

FastAPI queries Loki with:

```logql
{app="<service>"}
```

## Alerts flow

```text
Kubernetes metrics
  -> Prometheus rules
  -> Alertmanager
  -> webhook receiver
```

Important alerts:

- `PodCrashLooping`
- `HighCpuUsage`
- `ServiceDown`
- `DeploymentUnavailable`

For local demos, run:

```bash
python scripts/alert_receiver.py
```

Then configure Alertmanager to reach `http://host.docker.internal:9999/alerts` or port-forward as needed.

## Autoscaling flow

```text
Traffic/load
  -> backend CPU usage
  -> metrics-server
  -> HPA controller
  -> desired replicas
  -> Deployment
  -> new Pods
```

InfraWatch includes an HPA for `deployment/infrawatch-backend`:

- min replicas: 2
- max replicas: 6
- CPU target: 70%

This requires Minikube metrics-server:

```bash
minikube addons enable metrics-server
kubectl get hpa -n infrawatch -w
```

## Persistence flow

```text
FastAPI
  -> DATABASE_URL configured?
    -> yes: PostgreSQL deployments/audit tables
    -> no: JSON file fallback
```

Real local Kubernetes mode should use PostgreSQL. Demo Mode and tests can safely use JSON fallback.
